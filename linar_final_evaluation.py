""""1) Variable Data Types 
a) Create a variable called "Date_Of_Birth" and assign it the year you were born (or any random 
year) using the right datatype. Print the value of the variable. 
b) What is the difference between an integer and a floating-point number in Python? Backup your 
explanation with an example for each.

2) Basic Operations 
a) Write a Python program that adds two numbers together and prints the result. 
b) Write a Python program that takes a number as input and multiplies it by 10. Print the result.

3) Control Structures 
a) Write a Python program that checks if a number is even or odd. If the number is even, print 
"Even", otherwise print "Odd". 
b) Write a Python program that takes a number as input and checks if it is positive, negative, or 
zero. Print the result.

4) Lists and Loops 
a) Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10. Print each number in the list using a loop. 
b) Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the 
numbers in the list.
c) Create a dictionary ‘colleague_name’ storing all your colleague names. Hint: Use sequence of 
numbers as their key. 

5) Functions 
a) Write a Python function that takes three numbers as input and return their multiplication.
b) Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of all the 
numbers in the list.6) Libraries and Modules 

a) Install and Import the "math" module and use its "sqrt" function to calculate the square root 
of a number. 
b) Install and Import the "random" module and use its "randint" function to generate a random 
number between 1 and 10.
c) Install and Import the "pywhatkit" module and use its "whatsapp" function to send a DM to 
your tutor with the body “Good Day Sir”

escape sequence are characrter in programming languange that cannot be used in their
literal form unless when used with a backslash e.g #.


keyword are reserved word or reserved character used to perform a specific operation in 
programming language e.g in, for, if, try, except.


datatype it consist of value that determine a variable 
e.g interger, list, string

dictionary is a in built datatype tat is unordered which can be manipulated, remove, change
which consist of key and value 

module is a funtion of a class that act as an instance of a class 

interpreter it translate high level language to machine language line by line
